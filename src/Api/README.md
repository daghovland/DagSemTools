# C# Api

This is an API for reading RDF with OWL ontologies and apply reasoning. 

The functionality is not finished. The API is not stable and the documentation is not complete.

The class and method names are shamelessly stolen from [dotnetrdf](https://dotnetrdf.org).
This is done only to make it easier to switch between the two libraries.
There is no other connection with dotnetrdf, neither in the code or between people. 
There is also no intention to make this a drop-in replacement for dotnetrdf. Dotnetrdf 
is more mature and I use it myself for production use.
