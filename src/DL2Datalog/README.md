# Translator from description logic ALC to Datalog

This project has just started and is unfinished and not in a usable state. The goal is to implement the algorithm described in 
"Introduction to Description Logic" under the section on Query Answering in the description logic EL. 
Currently it seems that using the OWL2RL rules is a more fruitful approach, and this project is on hold.
