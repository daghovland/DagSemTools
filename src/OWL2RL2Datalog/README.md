# OWL 2 RL 2 Datalog

This project is a simple translation from OWL 2 RL to Datalog, mainly using the paper 
[DaRLing: A Datalog rewriter for OWL 2 RL ontological reasoning under SPARQL queries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02232) by
ALESSIO FIORENTINO, JESSICA ZANGARI and MARCO MANNA.

It also relies heavily on the W3C standards, specifically  https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/
