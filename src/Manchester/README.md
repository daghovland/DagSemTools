# Manchester Owl Parser

This is a parser for the Manchester Owl syntax, as defined in the [Manchester Owl spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/).

There is one major intended deviation from the standard: Only IRIs starting with http or https are allowed for absolute IRIs. 
This is a recommendation in the standard, but not a requirement. However, in all my usage this restriction has been useful.
