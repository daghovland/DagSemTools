# RDF2OWL

Extracts OWL Ontology in the form of DagSemTools.OwlOntology.Ontology
from Rdf in the form of DagSemTools.Rdf.TripleTable 
using the information at 
* [https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/mapping.html]()
* [https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-mapping-to-rdf/]()
* [https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Canonical_Parsing_of_OWL_2_Ontologies]()

I am, for security reasons, on purpose ignoring the requirements about including imported ontologies.
