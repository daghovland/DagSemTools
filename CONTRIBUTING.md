# Welcome to Dag's Semantic Technology Tools

The code is mainly implementations of W3C specifications, like Turtle, OWL etc and implementations of algorithms from papers and books on description logic. Minor fixes might be possible without any background, but for larger work you will probably have to read up on the relevant specification and/or algorithm.

Till now this has been my pet project, and I have no idea how it will work out with others contributing. Please make an issue first before spending a lot of time on a pull request. Especially issues about inconsistency related to a specification are useful. You can also wish or like issues about new features, like a new rdf language input/output or a new owl profile supported.
