# Welcome to Dag's Semantic Technology Tools

The code is mainly implementations of W3C specifications, like Turtle, OWL etc and implementations of algorithms from papers and books on description logic. Minor fixes might be possible without any background, but for larger work you will probably have to read up on the relevant specification and/or algorithm.

Till now this has been my pet project, and I have no idea how it will work out with others contributing. Please make an issue first before spending a lot of time on a pull request. Especially issues about inconsistency related to a specification are useful. You can also wish or like issues about new features, like a new rdf language input/output or a new owl profile supported. 

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with this project, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). 

If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See "[Label reference](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference)" for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

For extremely small changes, f.ex. typographic errors, you can do them directly in github. Github will create a new branch for you that you can make a pull request with.

### Commit your update

For most changes, a local git branch is recommended. 

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to use the "[Self review checklist](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/self-review-checklist)" to speed up the review process :zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, I will try to find time to review your proposal. I might ask questions or request additional information. If it is too complicated (I am not that smart) I might need you to make it smaller or easier to understand.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
