# Tests from Manchester 2 DL representation

This is an old test set that was originally used to test the Matchester parser into ALC
It is repurposed as an integration test set that tests that both the 
Manchester parser and the translation from OWLOntology to ALC are working.
New tests are not added, but the set is kept as it is useful.
