 # Test-data from dbpedia
 This directory contains test data copied from dbpedia
The directory therefore has different copyright and license (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License) than the rest of this repository.
The directory is only used in tests and is not included in the exported nuget packages.

The files in this folder are therefore not mine, but copyright Dbpedia foundation.
 Dbpedia is dual-licensed, I have chosen the Gnu Free Documentation License for this copy of the dbpedia data.
